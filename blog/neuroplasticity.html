            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Realising that the brain is mailable can help people understand that with hard work and dedication you can make a difference in your life.
              By taking a challenge with an open, learning mindset can help you form neurological bonds, which with 
              practice can help you improve with what you’re trying to do.
              The ted talk linked put emphasis on ‘not yet’ instead of not now. Using this when approaching something that might be difficult can help you become resilient and learn the problem and solutions. </p>
              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">how you might engage with the principles of Neuroplasticity for your benefit.</p>
              <p class="article-paragraph">
                To engage with these principles you need to come into a problem with an open mindset with intention of learning about it. You needs to then practice these things to form stronger neurological bonds and retain the learning that you’ve done. Understanding that if you do not practice or repeat these processes that they are at risk of becoming weaker or lost to other things.

              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplasticity?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              An example of this for me in my personal life recently has been learning to touch-type. I came into this challenge feeling like I had just learnt how to type, because I was essentially completely re-learning a skill I had. I’m continuing to do touch-typing practice everyday and also exclusively type using touch typing even when sometimes I know its not the fastest or most efficient way for me to type (YET!). In doing this I am strengthening my neurological bonds for typing and essentially forgetting about how I typed beforehand.

              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Discuss what growth mindset is and why it is relevant.</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              The growth mindset is a way of thinking of challenges. It’s about talking on a task or problem without the though of ‘what if I fail’ and replacing that with ‘im not sure if I can do this but it will be worth trying’. This change in mindset can help us in the long run being able to tackle difficult challenges and become more resilient.
              </p>
              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              I think what surprised is me is the realisation that I have a mixed mindset and I want to move on to growth mindset. I enjoy challenges but need to remove any doubt I might have and replace that with excitement about what im about to learn. Im also surprised about how ignoring any comparisons to other people can also help you accelerate your growth mindset. Once these thoughts are gone its going to be a lot easier to become better.</p>
              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Instead of defaulting to google when a challenge gets difficult I need to remember that these challenges are there to learn about the problems, and not necessarily about answering the problem. Once I practice my growth mindset more, getting the problems right will be a great byproduct and learning about why they were wrong, and how I can fix similar issues in the future will be the real win.</p>

              </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              As I mentioned above, taking a problem and running with it, opposed to running away from it, or running to answer will be the key to making the most out of my learning. Understanding that its not about getting from a to b but the journey it takes to get there is the most valuable part.</p>
