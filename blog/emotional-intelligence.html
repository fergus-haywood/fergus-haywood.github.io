            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions of both yourself and of others.
Emotional intelligence has 4 components: 
1. Perceiving Emotions.
	Understanding non-verbal signs such as body-language and facial expressions

2. Reasoning Emotions.
	Using emotions to promote thinking and cognitive activity. Emotions help prioritise what we pay attention to and react to.

3.  Understanding emotions
	if someone is expressing angry emotions then we need to understand what the cause of these emotions and what it could mean.

4. Managing Emotions
	The ability to regulate emotions and responding appropriately. Also responding to the emotions of others.

These 4 Components of emotional intelligence are ranked in order of difficulty.
Some examples of emotional intelligence are:

Being able to accept criticism and responsibility.
Being able to move on after making a mistake.
Being able to say no when you need to.
Being able to share your feelings with others.
Having empathy for other people.
Knowing why you do the things you do.
Not being judgemental of others.

Having emotional intelligence can also help us manage our emotions when stressed or feeling overwhelmed, have uncomfortable conversations with people without hurting feelings, and improve relationships with the people we care about.

            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">How is it different to IQ?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              IQ tests your knowledge to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognise emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions. It could be referred as book smarts (IQ) or street smarts (EQ).            
             </p>
              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Why is it important?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              EQ is important because it allows us to empathise with others, communicate effectively and be both self and socially aware. This helps us build stronger relationships, be more trustworthy, and deal with conflict, change and obstacles. Itâ€™s shown that EQ is more important than IQ in the work place and that people that show strong EQ skills will be be more successful in their work and personal lives.
