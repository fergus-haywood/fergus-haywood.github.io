            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Throughout the core learning modules I have learnt that I can get worked up over things when they are going wrong. I haven’t seen this so much in my DevAcademy work, but more in my freelance work. I have also learnt that I am in-between a fixed and growth mindset.

            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              These are all principles to keep in mind when programming. They can help us make the right decisions when it comes to work, but also when interacting with our peers when writing code.         
             </p>
              <p class="article-paragraph-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              At the start I wasn’t very excited to do the core learning - but only 5 weeks into it I am more open and happy to spend more time doing this, instead of only focusing on technical skills.
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              I found the initial values lesson hard as it was something that I hadn’t spent much time thinking about.  
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              This is going to help our hiring ability after the course is done. It will also help us become better versions of ourselves.
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              At the start thats what I thought, but now after practicing meditation often, I find myself using my time better and staying more focused on the technical learning. With the reflections exercises it also helps solidify the technical learning we have done.
